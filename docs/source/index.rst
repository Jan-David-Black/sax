Photonic Autograd and XLA - a JAX-based photonic
circuit simulator and optimizer for the frequency domain.

The goal of PhAX is to be a light wrapper around JAX with some basic tools for photonic

datastructures and tries to stay as close as possible to the functional nature of JAX.
This makes it very easy to get started with PhAX as you only need functions and standard
python dictionaries. Let's dive in...
